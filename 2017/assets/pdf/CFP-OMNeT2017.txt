                      CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

           *****  Submission Deadline June 30, 2017  *****
====================================================================

OMNeT++ is a public-source, component-based, modular and open-
architecture simulation environment with strong GUI support and an
embeddable simulation kernel. It is designed to simulate diverse
discrete event-based systems.

The OMNeT++ Community Summit is an open meeting with space for
tutorials, discussions, coding sessions as well as presentations on
recent developments and novel ideas in the broad area of modeling
and simulation, with a focus on the OMNeT++ simulation framework.
The OMNeT++ summit unites users, developers, and researchers to
discuss applications, developments, and ideas on the topics of
integrating simulation models, coupling different simulation tools
and providing more accurate and more efficient modeling approaches
and simulation models.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Design, evaluation, validation of simulation models
- Comparison with other simulation / emulation tools
- Parallel simulation and simulation control
- Integration of hardware-specific code
- Simulative approaches to performance evaluation
- Cross-layer protocol design methodologies
- Simulation credibility and validation
- Use of discrete event simulation in other domains
- Integration with other simulation tools
- Result interpretation and analysis
- Modeling techniques, including stochastic and hybrid modeling
- Simulation in the loop
- Industrial applications and practical use cases

-----------------------------
SUBMISSION and PARTICIPATION
-----------------------------
We invite researchers and users alike to submit one or more of
the following three contribution types:

a)  Full papers (max. 4 pages) are research papers that describe
    ongoing work or finalized results. Full papers that are
    accepted and presented at the summit will appear in the
    summit proceedings and be submitted to arXiv.

b)  Short abstracts (max. 1 page) provide an overview of a proposed
    presentation or demo. Authors may find this format suitable for
    design proposals, for preliminary or more narrowly focused work,
    for case studies, or to highlight OMNeT++-related results in
    work that has been published elsewhere. Short abstracts will be
    invited as either a presentation or a poster and will be 
	included in the summit proceedings.
	
c)  Proposals for tutorials, demonstrations, coding sessions,
    discussion panels, and other interactive community activities
    an be submitted to the organizers via e-mail:
    <omnetsummit2017@easychair.org>

All submissions should be of interest to the OMNeT++ community.
We welcome case studies that employ OMNeT++ in the evaluation of
systems as well as contributions addressing general questions of
OMNeT++-based simulations. For model-centric submissions we ask
the author(s) to publicize source code at the time of submission.

Submissions will be checked by the technical program committee
and the organizers. Individual contributions will be invited as
oral presentations, demos, tutorials or panels, depending on the
submission type and the expected interest for the OMNeT++ community.
We will provide poster slots for all interested participants.

Full papers and short abstracts should be prepared with the IEEE
conference proceedings template (A4 page size, conference mode).
Detailed instructions are available on the summit website:
http://summit.omnetpp.org/2017/

The proceedings will be published as a technical report via arXiv
and the OMNeT++ website.
Copyrights will remain solely with the authors.
This allows for a publication of revised versions at other venues.

The OMNeT++ Community Summit is sponsored and free to attend by
everyone. Registration fees will not be applied.
