        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.0em;">The ninth OMNeT++ Community Summit will be held virtually on 2nd November, 2022.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.0em;">OMNeT++ is a public-source, component-based, modular and open-architecture simulation environment with strong GUI support and an embeddable simulation kernel. It is designed to simulate discrete event systems, with the simulation of communication networks as one of its primary application areas.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 1.0em;">In continuation of the history of the <a href="//summit.omnetpp.org/archive/" target="_blank">International Workshop on OMNeT++</a> and seven very successful editions of its reincarnation, the <strong>OMNeT++ Community Summit</strong>, we continue to hold a yearly open meeting for all OMNeT++ community members with less costs and more interaction possibilities.
		The Community Summit provides a forum for tutorials, discussion sessions and presentations on recent developments and novel ideas in the area of simulation and modeling, with a focus on the OMNeT++ simulation environment.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 1.0em;">The first seven Summits in Hamburg, Zurich, Brno, Bremen, Pisa, Hamburg and the later virtual ones were huge successes with lively discussions, keynotes, tutorials, panels, presentations, and demonstrations of ongoing and finalized research covering many aspects of OMNeT++-related research.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <p>The OMNeT++ Community Summit is an open meeting with time and space for tutorials, discussions, coding sessions as well as presentations on recent developments and novel ideas in the broad area of modeling and simulation, with a focus on the OMNeT++ simulation framework. The OMNeT++ Community Summit unites users, developers, and researchers to discuss applications, developments, and ideas on the topics of integrating simulation models, coupling different simulation tools and providing more accurate and more efficient modeling approaches and simulation models.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>To facilitate the interaction among participants, the summit employs a highly interactive presentation format called ConverStation, which provides much more feedback and useful discussion time than traditional talks. More information will be provided to presenters and audience at a due time.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Following the success of previous editions, the 2021 Community Summit will include a hackathon event. This provides the chance for developers of simulation models and frameworks to consult OMNeT++ core developers and fellow developers, to improve the quality and interoperability of models and frameworks. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Scientific contributions will be reviewed by the technical program committee and (if accepted and presented at the summit) will be included in the proceedings, which will be published in arXiv. The submission copyright will be retained by the authors.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Submission and Participation:</p>
        <br/>
        <ul style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Scientific contributions (up to 8 pages)</strong> are full research papers that describe ongoing work or finalized results. Full papers that are reviewed and accepted by the TPC and presented at the summit will appear in the summit proceedings that are published in arXiv.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Short abstracts (up to 3 pages)</strong> provide overviews of a proposed presentation or demonstration. Authors may find this format suitable for design proposals, for preliminary or more narrowly focused work, for case studies, or to highlight OMNeT++-related results in work that has been published elsewhere. Short abstracts will be invited as  either a presentation, as a demonstration, or a poster and will be published on the summit website</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Hackathon proposal abstracts (up to 1 page)</strong> propose a topic for a hackathon. This can be the optimization of an ongoing OMNeT++ project, porting of frameworks to the newest OMNeT++ and INET versions, and many more. They should be submitted via e-mail to the organizers (<a href="mailto:omnetsummit2021@easychair.org">omnetsummit2021@easychair.org</a>). Specific “call for hackathons” including detailed instructions will be distributed separately and made available on the summit website.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Proposals for tutorials, demonstrations, coding sessions, discussion panels,</strong> and other <strong>interactive community activities</strong> can be submitted via e-mail to the organizers (<a href="mailto:omnetsummit2021@easychair.org">omnetsummit2021@easychair.org</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All submissions should be of interest to the OMNeT++ community. We welcome case studies that employ OMNeT++ in the evaluation of systems as well as contributions addressing general questions of OMNeT++-based simulations. For model-centric submissions, we encourage the author(s) to publicize source code at the time of submission. Proposals for individual contributions will be invited depending on the submission type and based on the expected interest for the OMNeT++ community. Contributions should be prepared according to the submission guidelines provided in arXiv. <strong>Submission deadline: July 26, 2021.</strong></p>
      <br/>
      <p>Continuing the tradition of previous years, another hackathon will be co-located with this year&#39;s OMNeT++ Community Summit. The hackathon gives developers of simulation models and simulation frameworks the chance to consult and team-up with the OMNeT++ core developer team and fellow framework developers, in order to improve the quality and interoperability of simulation models and frameworks and to work on topics proposed by the developers themselves. Participants and topics will be selected based on prior written project proposals. <strong>Hackathon proposal submission deadline: August 08, 2021.</strong></p>
