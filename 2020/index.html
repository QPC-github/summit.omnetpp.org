        <span>
          With the advancements of in-vehicle communication systems and the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial operations, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) became an essential target for network simulation. TSN is a set of standards, developed by the IEEE 802.1 working group, that define mechanisms for the time-sensitive transmission of data over deterministic Ethernet networks.
          <br><br>
          The current version of INET lacks important infrastructure components for TSN simulations: clock models, time synchronization protocols, a versatile queueing model for transmission selection, the general support for aborting transmissions, and an API for intra-node packet streaming. The presentation covers the latest developments regarding these topics.

          <span>
            Clemm and Eckert propose Latency-Based Forwarding (LBF) as a novel approach to provide
            support for high-precision latency objectives. It prioritizes traffic with introducing
            packet metadata which carries latency objectives, and the metadata allows different actions
            to be taken at network nodes. A proof of concept simulation model has been developed using the Big Packet
            Protocol (BPP). In contrast to IntServ, LBF supports prioritizing specific packets, with
            the purpose of providing fairness among different applications. We have run OMNeT++ simulations
            and compared our simulation results to the emulation results, with the goal of
            validating the results of Clemm and Eckert.

        <span class="dropabstract">Proposed research topic: Using neural networks and machine learning <br>for deriving error models for WiFi and other wireless networks
          <span>In wireless network simulations, an error model describes how the signal to noise ratio (SNR) affects the amount of errors at the receiver. Given that SNR is a multi-dimensional function over time and frequency, and given the diversity of coding and modulation schemes used in wireless networks, writing a good and efficient error model is a very difficult problem. Existing error models are often closed formulas derived from empirical observations, and in addition to being very limited in scope, they sometimes fall down even within their supposed limitations. In contrast, we propose using neural networks and deep learning techniques to produce an error model that, in addition to being universally applicable, can produce reasonable answers even for cases that it was not explicitly trained for.

          We propose this as a research topic for those potentially interested in pursuing it. It is very promising as a research topic, practically feasible, and very useful at the same time. We have already spent some time trying out the idea and proven (at least to ourselves) that it is feasible and the approach outlined here can be made to work, but we don't have the resources (mostly, time) to elaborate it in-house. If you are a researcher (e.g. PhD student) looking for an exciting and rewarding topic to work on, we'd love to hear from you. We recommend this research topic primarily to those who are already knowledgeable in the field of neural networks and machine learning, and are not afraid of applying this knowledge to something new.

        <span class="dropabstract">Implementation of MANET routing protocols with OMNeT++ : A DSR-Flow showcase
          <span>
            In unstructured and mobile networks such as MANETs, routing may become a real challenge
            due to frequent topology changes. Routing protocols are classified in 3 categories:
            proactive, reactive and hybrid. Proactive protocols send periodic messages to discover its
            neighborhood and construct the topology, whereas reactive ones ask for new routes only on
            demand. Finally, hybrid protocols combine both proactive and reactive features.
            Our aim is to conduct a comparison study of various routing protocols: AODV, OLSR,
            DSR under UAV-like mobility model regarding their performances mainly in terms of end-to-
            end delay, network load, and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). This requires the implementation
            of the DSR-flow extension in OMNeT++.<br><br>

            In this work, we provide guidelines to OMNeT++ users to implement a routing protocol
            with INET/INETMANET projects. We describe how we managed to implement a simple
            version of the well-known routing protocol DSR and its flow extension.
            Our contribution is threefold. First, we defined and extended data-structures and classes
            of INET/INETMANET to get a classic version of the DSR protocol. Then, we implemented
            the flow extension by using the classic DSR implementation and finally, we used specific UDP
            applications to provide stream traffic generation in order to compare features and performance
            of both protocols.
            We are particularly interested by the end-to-end management feature that could guarantee
            a certain QoS level for a dedicated service. Hence, we focused on core concepts of the DSR-
            Flow extension (i.e flow labelling) and did not implemented yet rare options such as "default
            flow" feature and "Destination and Flow ID" option which do not enter our domain of interest.
            We plan to open-source our implementation in the future.

        <span class="dropabstract">Proposed research topic: Zero configuration automatic parallel simulation
          <span>OMNeT++ already supports parallel simulation. However, the network must be partitioned manually, and the partitions run concurrently in separate processes communicating over MPI. Here we propose a parallel simulation approach relies on multi-threaded execution instead of communicating processes, and therefore, by eliminating MPI overhead, it can make much better use of shared-memory multiprocessors which are e.g. commonly available on everyone's desk as multi-core CPU laptop/desktop computers. Moreover, it requires no prior knowledge or manual configuration about the simulation model. This makes it potentially both significantly more efficient (higher speedup), and also more accessible and convenient to use than the existing solution.

        <span class="dropabstract">Timing Analysis of SpaceWire using OMNeT++ based Simulator
          <span>The SpaceWire is a standard for communication for on-board spacecraft.
            SpaceWire is nominated by ESA and planned to be the only communication
            standard for spacecrafts in the future. It is already in use by several missions which
            are currently in operation. The SpaceWire protocol is not a deterministic
            protocol. It supports arbitrarily large sizes of messages with possibility of
            different datarates. It has wormhole routing in routers which may block critical
            messages for large amounts of time. It also has very low buffer memory and
            no virtual channel support. These conditions makes SpaceWire’s timings very
            uncertain. Embedded system developers need a realistic bound on the end-to-end
            delay for messages sent over the SpaceWire to design software with more
            predictable timing properties.
            Worst-case analysis of the end-to-end delay reports very pessimistic
            bounds, which are not applicable for many applications. A good simulator can
            provide less pessimistic bounds. It can provide accurate modeling of the network
            and its timing behavior. <br><br>

            First, we will show the implementation of SpaceWire’s
            routing strategies in OMNeT++. Then an implementation of wormhole routing will be presented.
            Based on routing strategies, end-to-end delay for
            messages considering different network scenarios will be analyzed. The blocking
            of packets in the router will also be demonstrated.  Future work may focus on
            network emulation and test and validation process.

        <span class="dropabstract">Computational Evaluation of the Effects of Openflow and Ospf Routing<br>
          on Quality of Service Metrics in a Large Simulated Mobile Core Internet Protocol Network<br>
          Using OMNeT++
          <span>
            Mobile Internet Protocol (IP) phone networks are arguably one of the most important innovations
            of modern times. More access systems are increasingly being defined using IP and as a result one
            of the challenging tasks that mobile IP phone service companies have to deal with is an upsurge
            of user equipment (UE) which in turn places excessive demand on the routing infrastructure and
            degrades quality of service (QoS) values at the mobile core network. Studies show that majority
            of mobile IP phone subscriber companies struggle to meet acceptable QoS values due to their
            insistence on using classical routing methods. Classical routing is not easily scalable and often
            lacks central source of information. There is an attempt to explore emerging Software Defined
            Network (SDN) technologies to enhance scalability and promote centralized controller approach.
            OpenFlow routing is an instance of SDN that has been found to improve routing in wired and small
            wireless networks. <br><br>

            The aim of this study was to evaluate the computational effects that OpenFlow
            and OSPF would have on routing in a large mobile core IP
            network. Specifically, the study evaluated the effects of the use of OpenFlow and OSPF routing
            on jitter, packet delivery ratio (PDR), throughput and end to end delay. This research adopted
            exploratory research design where OMNeT++
            network emulator was used in addition to SimuLTE add on to model two mobile IP networks;
            OSPF routed and OpenFlow. Applications that present high demand for processing and routing
            used; interactive gaming, VoIP, audio streaming and Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) were
            used for the purposes of testing routing efficiency. Scenario manager was used to simulate network
            failure and renewed convergence was observed. The setup test environment consisted of 1000
            UEs, 80 OSPF routers, 80 OpenFlow switches. The study used already existing tools in OMNeT++
            namely scenario manager, UEs, OSPF and OpenFlow routers to build test environment.<br><br>

            OpenFlow was observed to manage better the QoS metrics in large mobile core network compared to OSPF
            routing. Notably jitter was improved by 10 milliseconds when OpenFlow routing was used in
            comparison to OSPF. This improvement was consistent across the network with addition of more
            end user equipment (UE). In instances where OSPF improved routing speeds the value is less
            significant with standard deviation of 24 mbs. This study provides insight on how OpenFlow
            can improve routing efficiency in large mobile core IP network compared to classical routing
            approach. This study further recommends testing of OpenFlow in production networks.

            Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol was published as RFC with the blessing of Cisco a few years ago. EIGRP is just like Babel hybrid routing protocol that leverages the best features of both distance-vector and link-state routing protocols. Properties like adjacency detection, multi-address family support, and the famous DUAL algorithm make EIGRP enterprise solution (that offers “loop-free routing” even during network reconvergence). We have successfully implemented EIGRP supporting IPv4 and IPv6 for ANSA; and now is the excellent time to incorporate EIGRP directly into INET.

        <span class="dropabstract">Evaluation of Avionic Routing Protocols using a Multiscale Simulation in OMNeT++
          <span>
            One focus at the Institute of Communication Networks at the Hamburg University of Technology is routing for avionic applications. Here, especially the case of aircraft crossing the North Atlantic Corridor (NAC) between Europe and North America is an interesting scenario as it is the busiest airspace of the world without any ground infrastructure. Obtaining performance indicators for routing protocols on this scenario from simulations creates a challenging task: On the one hand, mobility has a strong effect on the routing performance as it defines the topology of the network. On the other hand, realistic link and PHY layer implementations are necessary to obtain meaningful end-2-end delays. While mobility over the NAC is a slow moving process, requiring the simulation to cover five to six hours of mobility with topology changes on the scale of minutes, a realistic lower layer implementation will create events every few milliseconds. <br><br>

            A simulation covering both the mobility as well as the lower layer communication protocols at the same time is computationally infeasible. Therefore the concept of Multiscale Simulations emerge: The core idea is to split the simulation effort into two, where a fast running "Macro Scale" simulation evaluates the mobility with simplified lower layers and creates snapshots of the simulation to be investigated in more detail. Those snapshots are then picked up by a "Micro Scale" simulation which starts a simulation of the created snapshot with a full lower layer implementation.

          We will shortly introduce the RPL protocol and the RFC 6550 features implemented in our simulation model.
          We will provide and overview of our implementation structure and present example scenarios and showcases.
